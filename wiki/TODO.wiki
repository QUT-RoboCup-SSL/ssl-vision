#summary A list of planned features and improvements to ssl-vision

= TODO =
This page is a TODO list of new features and improvements for ssl-vision. If you would like to suggest other wishes/features or are interested in working on an unassigned issue, please let us know by becoming a member of the email-list http://groups.google.com/group/ssl-vision.

== Bugs ==
For bugs and other problems, please use the "Issue" tracker: http://code.google.com/p/ssl-vision/issues/list 

== Usability Features: ==
  * buttons to sync the multiple segmentation LUTs (*assigned to: Stefan*)
  * a selection field to manually disable/enable certain robots of a team
  * visualization of the field and detection results, such as robot positions / angles / certainties (*assigned to: Joydeep*)
  * visualization of the stack, showing the order and names of plugins, allowing check-boxes to enable/disable each plugin. This could become another tab on the left, where the data-tree is currently the only tab. This should also include optional visualization of the measured processing time values of each plugin.
  * command line options to run in console-only (maybe -c) mode and to immediately start capturing on startup (maybe -s)

== Processing Improvements: ==
  * finish the "near-robot" filter in the ball detection plugin (*assigned to: Stefan*)
  * fix switching between different team definitions during runtime (*assigned to: Stefan*)
  * cached readout of vartype values (*assigned to: Stefan*)
  * Allow network clients to request calibration data. Currently the camera calibration data and field dimensions are sent over the network only if the "publish" button is hit in the GUI. We might want to let clients request this data, and also auto re-publish this data if it is changed in the GUI.

== Capturing: ==
  * support of GigE vision input (*assigned to: GaTech*)
  * support of V4L input
  * improvement of the read from file capture. See also "DVR" plugin below.

== New Plugins: ==
  * "DVR" plugin, basically allowing to buffer / record to file / read from file / pause / delay / replay / seek video.
  * "competition mode" plugin, which checks and ensures that all settings of the system are set correctly for maximum performance (e.g. visualizations are turned off, DCAM parameter auto-refresh is turned off, video capture and convert to are both set to yuv422, shutter-speed is set to some value below the frame period). This plugin really only needs two push-buttons "Check" and "Auto-Fix" and an informational label.
  * "goal detection" plugin which automatically saves the captured image to a file and possibly lights up in the GUI if the ball entered a goal. This can help the refs to determine the validity of some of those questionable goals.
  * "confidence masking" plugin which allows to draw a mask layer on top of the video frame to disable processing of certain regions in the image.
