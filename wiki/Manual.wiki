#summary The manual for installing, configuring, and using SSL-Vision

= Introduction =

In the past, !RoboCup Small Size League rules allowed every
team to set up their own global vision system as a primary sensor. This
option beared several organizational limitations and thus impaired the league's progress. Additionally, most teams have converged on very similar solutions, and have produced only few significant research results to this global vision problem over
the last years. Hence, in 2009 the responsible committees decided to migrate to vision system (including hardware) that could be shared among all teams. This system - named SSL-Vision - is currently developed
by volunteers from participating teams. This manual describes the
current state and usage of SSL-Vision.
