#summary The manual for installing, configuring, and using SSL-Vision

= Introduction =

The current !RoboCup Small Size League rules allow every
team to set up their own global vision system as a primary sensor. This
option, which is used by all participating teams, bears several organiza-
tional limitations and thus impairs the league's progress. Additionally,
most teams have converged on very similar solutions, and have produced
only few signicant research results to this global vision problem over
the last years. Hence the responsible committees decided to migrate to a
shared vision system (including also sharing the vision hardware) for all
teams by 2010. This system - named SSL-Vision - is currently developed
by volunteers from participating teams. This manual describes the
current state and usage of SSL-Vision.
