#summary The manual for installing, configuring, and using SSL-Vision

= Introduction =

In the past, !RoboCup Small Size League rules allowed every
team to set up their own global vision system as a primary sensor. This
option beared several organizational limitations and costs for the teams, thus impairing the league's progress. Additionally, most teams had converged on similar solutions and produced few significant research results to this global vision problem over the last years. 

In 2009, the league committees decided to migrate to a shared vision system (including hardware) that could be used by all teams. This system - named SSL-Vision - is currently developed by volunteers from participating teams. This manual describes the current state and usage of SSL-Vision.
