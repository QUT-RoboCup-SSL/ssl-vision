#summary One-sentence summary of this page.
This page documents how geometry calibration (estimation of camera parameters including intrinsics and extrinsics) is implemented in ssl-vision.
 
= Flow of Control =

The flow of control involved in geometry calibration is as follows:

  # The control points are initialized interactively by dragging their markers in the *CameraCalibrationWidget* .
  # Subsequent steps assume that the camera height, radial distortion, and other parameters have been initialized.
  # For the initial calibration, *CameraParameters::calibrate* is called with cal_type = INITIAL_ESTIMATION. This estimates the camera parameters using only 4 constraints, corresponding to the control points.
  # The user then visually inspects the results and accordingly sets the edge detection margins.
  # When the "Detect Edges" button is clicked, the images are searched for edges in the vicinity of the field markings in *PluginCameraCalibration::detectEdges*.
