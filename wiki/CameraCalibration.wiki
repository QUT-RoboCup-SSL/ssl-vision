== Calibration Procedure ==

In order to obtain information about the action on the field from
the camera images, a camera calibration routine has to be performed. 
This routine is performed as follows:

Activate the Camera Calibration Tab on the right. Adjust the camera 
height according to your setup. Drag the four points constraining 
the half-field to their location in the image plane. Press "Do 
initial calibration". After that, you should see a field and a grid 
drawn from red lines in the image, which only matches the real field 
very roughly.

The initial setup using the four points does not take distortion 
into account. Therefore, manually adjust the distortion (values between 
-0.1 and -0.2 worked for us) and, again, press "Do initial calibration".
After that, the red field lines and the grid should reflect the 
distortion. From this parameters, additional feature points of the field 
can be computed. For this, click "Detect additional calibration points" 
and small red boxes should appear along the lines indicating the 
additional feature points. To perform the optimization using these 
additional points, press "Do full calibration" and the camera geometry 
should be calibrated.

By pressing "Reset", default values will be assigned to the camera 
geometry parameters.

The calibration routine can be tested using the sample image from the 
"test-data" directory. Unfortunately, this image shows a 2008 SSL-field, 
therefore, the projected red lines will not exactly match the actual 
field lines, but it should be sufficient to get the idea how the routine 
is performed.
